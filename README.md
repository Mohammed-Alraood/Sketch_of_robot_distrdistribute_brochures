This is a part of the Smart Methods training,  
MG995 High Speed Metal Gear Dual Ball Bearing Servo
for the joint of the upper parts of the Puppy Robot, and the reasons of choosing this servo are:
1. The connection cable is thicker.
2. Cheap and strong.
3. Equips high-quality motor.
4. High resolution.
5. Accurate positioning.
6. Fast control response.
7. Constant and high torque throughout the servo travel range. It equips sophisticated
internal circuitry that provides good torque, holding power, and faster updates in
response to external forces.
8. Excellent holding power.
9. They donâ€™t take much space since they are packed within a tight sturdy plastic case
which makes them water and dust resistant which is very useful in the robot joints.
Moreover, the needs of the servo to operate this robot show that MG995 is fair enough to fullfill the requirment
